\@doendnote{endnote1}{The range of data must be selected when fitting the Lorentzian functions to $\Phi $ or $\Phi '$. This range should be large enough for the Lorentzian functions to decrease significantly from their value at half-width at half-maximum, where the linewidth is specified, but not too large as to pick up noise. The error in predicting the lifetime is obtained by varying the range of data used to fit the Lorentzian function.}
